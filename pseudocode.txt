Tic Tac Toe

This game takes a 3x3 grid, where there are two players. 
Each player is either an X or an O. 
Each player takes a turn to place their respective symbol on 
a square in the 3x3 grid.
The first player to place 3 of their symbols in a row in a 
row, column or diagonal, wins the game.
If the grid is filled before either player achieves a win,
then there is a draw.

For this program, it will start the game for the user, giving them the
option to choose either symbol as an option.
Next it will start the game, by random, with either the player or 
the computer starting.
Every time the computer has the chance to play, it will give a small
wait time to simulate the computer thinking.
Each turn will show the 3x3 grid updated with the respective slots marked.
Once the table is full or if there is a winner, then the game will end.

It'll ask the user if they want to play again.

Finally will show final tally.

Example of the grid:

 1 | 2 | 3
===========   
 4 | 5 | 6  
===========
 7 | 8 | 9  

 0 | 1 | 2
===========   
 3 | 4 | 5  
===========
 6 | 7 | 8  


How to store each of the players marks:
Use a dictionary or an array. Ask the player for a spot and the data structure
will be populated with the player's character.

How to check when there is a win:
Traverse through the data structure and check if there are any matches to end 
the round.
Need to do more research to find a better way for this.
